# tdd-assessment

## Set Up

1. Fork and clone this repo
1. `npm install`

## Instructions

1. Write all of your tests in main.test.js then make the function in main.js pass the tests. WRITE ALL THE TESTS FIRST!

Remember "Red, Green, Refactor"
Use the [Mocha Chia Assertion library](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/) as a reference for building out your tests.
Consider translating all of the instructions in `main.test.js` into individual test descriptsions.
- Note: if you write out a test with only a description and no callback it will default to a pending state
- `it('should do stuff and things')`
