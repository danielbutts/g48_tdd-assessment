# tdd-assessment

## Set Up

1. Fork and clone this repo
1. `npm install`

## Instructions

1. Write a test in main.test.js then make the function in main.js pass the test
1. Write the next test and make the function pass that test, plus all previous tests.
1. Repeat until all tests are written and passing.

Remember "Red, Green, Refactor"
Use the [Mocha Chia Assertion library](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/) as a reference for building out your tests.
Consider translating all of the instructions in `main.test.js` into individual test descriptsions.
- Note: if you write out a test with only a description and no callback it will default to a pending state
- `it('should do stuff and things')`
